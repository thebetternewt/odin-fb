# Odin Facebook Application

This application was built as the final project for [The Odin Project's](http://theodinproject.com) Ruby on Rails course in which a mock Facebook application is built. Details can be found [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project).

## What I Learned

This project shows my understanding of:

* Use the Devise gem for handling user sessions, login/logout, etc.
* Building a very functional Rails application from the ground up.
* Using the letter_opener gem for testing emails.
* Using rspec for testing.
